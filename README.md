# Pokemon-Inverse-Emerald
This is a ROM hack of Pokemon Emerald where the type chart is inverted so that moves that were once super effective are now resisted and vise versa.
How to Play:
1. Download the Pokemon Inverse Emerald.xdelta file.
2. Download an un-patched version of Pokemon Emerald.
3. Use an app or website (https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/) to patch the file.
4. Make sure you have a Game Boy Advanced emulator downloaded and run the patched version.

Changes Made:
. The type chart has now been reversed so anything that was super effective before is now resisted, and anything resisted is now super effective. Immunities are still the same as before.
. Fairy type and updated catching mechanics

Credits:
. Hack created by IanF0 using pokeemerald (created by pret) and pokeemerald-expansion (created by rh-hideout)
