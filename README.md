# Pokemon-Inverse-Emerald
This is a ROM hack of Pokemon Emerald where the type chart is inverted so that moves that were once super effective are now resisted and vice versa.

How to Play:
1. Download the Pokemon Inverse Emerald.xdelta file.
2. Download an un-patched version of Pokemon Emerald.
3. Use an app or website (https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/) to patch the file.
4. Make sure you have a Game Boy Advanced emulator downloaded and run the patched version.
5. For any future updates, download the new patch and then patch it to the base Emerald ROM (same as step 3) and your save data will carry over.
6. (Optional) The Inverse Type Chart is an Excel sheet that has all of the new type matchups listed out, so download that if you want to.


Changes Made:

. The type chart has now been reversed so anything that was super effective before is now resisted, and anything that was resisted is now super effective. Immunities are still the same as before. Look at the inverse type chart excel sheet for more details.

. Added Fairy types

. Add the Physical/Special split

. All Pokemon have their Gen 7 movesets

. All Pokemon that evolve through trade can now be evolved using the Linking Cord item and all Pokemon that evolve through trade while holding an item now just evolve by using that item on the Pokemon

. Reusable TMs

. Modern shiny odds (1/4096)

. Updated UI for catching Pokemon

. Rare Candies in every main shop for $500 (to help reduce grinding)

. All items used for evolution (Fire Stone, Linking Cord, Dragon Scale, etc.) can be purchased on the 4th floor of the Lilycove Department Store and Heart Scales can be purchased on the second floor. 

. This ROM hack uses pokeemerald and pokeemerald expansion, and they are not compatible with cheats. Cheats may corrupt game files, so test them out at your own risk.
